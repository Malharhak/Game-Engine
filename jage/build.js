    //mode to minify the code. Only available if running the optimizer using
    //Java.

    //section of the config) and any other JS file in the directory. However, if
    //the non-build bundle JS files will not be loaded after a build, you can

    //project optimization, but do not plan on dynamically loading non-build
    //bundle JS files later. In this case, the normalization just slows down
    //builds, so you can explicitly set this value to "skip".
